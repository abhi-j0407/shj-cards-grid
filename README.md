# Objective

Convert XD design of a grid of cards section to code.
Done using HTML & CSS.

# Assumptions

* Minor assumptions regarding responsive widths were made, ensuring pixel perfect design adoption.
* Stock images from Unsplash were used, since XD assets weren't available for download.
* A free alternative (Fira Sans Extra Condensed) was used instead of Futura PT, Cond Bold.
